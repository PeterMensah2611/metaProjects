# Kcoin Solidity Token Contract

This is a simple Solidity smart contract for managing a token called Kcoin (KC). The contract allows for token creation (minting) and destruction (burning) while ensuring that burning tokens only occurs if the sender has a sufficient balance.

## Features

- Create and manage a token with a name (Kcoin), abbreviation (KC), and a total supply.
- Mint new tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
- Burn existing tokens from specific addresses, with balance checks to prevent excessive burning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - Make sure you have Solidity installed on your development environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   
Navigate to the project directory

cd your-repo


Usage
Minting Tokens
To mint new tokens and distribute them to a specific address, call the mint function with the desired recipient's address and the number of tokens to mint.

- Mint new tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
- Burn existing tokens from specific addresses, with balance checks to prevent excessive burning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - Make sure you have Solidity installed on your development environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Compile the Solidity contract using your preferred development environment or Solidity compiler.

Usage
Minting Tokens
To mint new tokens and distribute them to a specific address, call the mint function with the desired recipient's address and the number of tokens to mint.

Example:

solidity
Copy code
// Mint 100 Kcoins and send them to '0xReceiverAddress'
contractInstance.mint(0xReceiverAddress, 100);

Burning Tokens
To burn existing tokens from a specific address, call the burn function with the sender's address and the number of tokens to burn. Ensure that the sender has a sufficient balance to burn the tokens, as this function includes a balance check.

Contract Details
tokenName: The name of the token (e.g., "Kcoin").
tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token (e.g., "KC").
totalSupply: The total supply of Kcoins.
balances: A mapping of addresses to their Kcoin balances.
mint: Function to mint new Kcoins and distribute them to an address.
burn: Function to burn Kcoins from a specific address, with balance checks.
