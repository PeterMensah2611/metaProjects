# Project Title

Simple Solidity Contract with Error Handling Examples

## Description

This Solidity contract demonstrates different error-handling mechanisms in Solidity: `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. The contract also showcases basic access control by allowing the owner to change the contract's `name` variable.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To interact with this contract or deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain, you'll need:

- A development environment with Solidity support (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).
- Access to an Ethereum network (e.g., a local development network or a public testnet).
- Ethereum wallet or client (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with the contract.

### Executing program

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network using a Solidity development environment.
2. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using functions such as `usingRequire`, `usingRevert`, and `usingAssert`.
3. Ensure you have the required permissions (i.e., you are the contract owner) when using the `usingRequire` function, or the transaction will fail with an error message.
4. Use the appropriate function with the desired `_name` parameter to set the contract's `name` variable.
